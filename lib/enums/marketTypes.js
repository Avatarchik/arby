	 * " Outright bet is a bet placed on the outcome of an entire league or competition rather than on an individual game.
	 *   Outright bets are usually placed before the season starts but are also available even during the course of the competition. "
	 *
	 * " These kinds of bets are characterized by much higher returns when compared to regular match bets and as such are
	 *   very appealing to a huge number of sports punters. "

	 * " Besides betting on a winner of the competition, you can predict teamâ€™s
	 *   finishing position, bet on a number of season points or back a player to score most goals. The number of outright bets
	 *   is increasing every season and these are becoming extremely popular among the players. "
