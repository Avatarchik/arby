/**
 * Equivalences & Market Overlaps
 *
 * A 'Double Chance' bet which covers 1 team with the draw (Team A or Draw) is equivalent to a +0.5 Asian Handicap on that same team:
 *
 * Team A wins 1-0 so your Double Chance comes in as well as your Asian Handicap bet
 * It is a draw 1-1 so your Handicap comes in when applied as well as your Double Chance on the draw
 * Team B wins 1-0 so you lose your Double Chance & your Handicap as well
 *
 * A -0.5 handicap (on Team A) is the same as ONE_X_TWO bet on the same team:
 *
 * Team A wins 1-0 so win ONE_X_TWO and due to half point, still win handicap
 * Draw results in a loss of both bets
 * Team B wins 1-0 so lose ONE_X_TWO as well as lose handicap
 *
 * No team to score === correct score of 0-0... obvs
 *
 * As such, it is easy to see that a +0.5 handicap can be used with a 3-way ONE_X_TWO bet to create a simple 2-way bet arb
 * (as the ONE or the TWO is ONE_X_TWO === -0.5 handicap)
 * Similarly, a Double Chance bet can be easily used with a -0.5 handicap, or with a draw bet to create an arb
 *
 *
 *
 * A lot of events have the market types;
 *
 * - SPECIAL
 * - UNDIFFERENTIATED
 *
 * For now I am going to leave these be but worth looking into them so I can categorise them
 *
 *
 * I have attempted to categorise these markets via the number of runners that they have
 * I did this by comparing on Betfair exchange
